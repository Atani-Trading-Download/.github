## What is Atani Trading?

Atani is an all-in-one cryptocurrency trading platform that connects to multiple exchanges through API while providing unified portfolio management and tax reporting capabilities. The software aggregates trading activity across connected exchanges, giving users a comprehensive view of their crypto holdings and trading history.

The platform stands out with its built-in tax calculation engine that automatically generates reports compliant with regulations in multiple jurisdictions. Traders can visualize their portfolio allocation, track performance metrics, and execute trades across different exchanges without leaving the Atani interface.

Atani's trading terminal offers professional charting tools with technical indicators and drawing capabilities. The interface supports limit, market, and stop orders with customizable templates for frequent trading pairs. Advanced users appreciate the multi-exchange arbitrage opportunities that become visible through the unified order book display.

Security is prioritized through read-only API keys by default, with optional trading permissions. The software doesn't hold user funds, interacting with exchanges only through secure API connections. Available as desktop application and mobile app, Atani provides traders with access to their unified trading environment across devices.
